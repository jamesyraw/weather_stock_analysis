# weather_stock_analysis

For this project, I wanted to find if the weather at my home could be a bell cow for any stock. In other words, the warmer (or colder, or rainier, etc.) it is at my home, the more a stock price would increase or decrease. I would like to identify which stock correlates the closest to my local weather, the degree to which that correlation exists, and the Sharpe ratio to determine if this is actually a viable trading strategy. As a quick hypothesis, I don't think it will be, but this is for fun and really to test my skills using Python for data analysis. I will be using Python (along with numpy, pandas, math, and functools) to handle the large dataset of daily stock prices for every stock going back
